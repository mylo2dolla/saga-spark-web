# Supabase Edge Functions (Source Archive Only)

Active runtime is VM-hosted:

- `/functions/v1/<function-name>` on your Hetzner API

Supabase remains:

- Auth (`/auth/v1/*`)
- Postgres database

This directory is retained as historical source reference only.

Do not deploy Supabase Edge Functions for this project.
Runtime execution is VM-only.
